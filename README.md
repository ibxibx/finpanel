## 📅 Practical Plan for further development

To ensure consistent progress and maximize learning outcomes, the following strategy will be implemented:

### Development Approach
- Building mini-projects for each subsequent task to strengthen hands-on experience and confidence in React.js
- Completing 2–3 tasks per week to allow buffer time for learning and troubleshooting
- Focusing on functionality first, followed by design refinements

### Technology Integration
- Leveraging additional libraries like Material-UI, React Query, or Chart.js to streamline development
- Implementing advanced features progressively alongside mini-project execution
- Refining FinPanel's UI/UX based on insights gained from each completed task

### Timeline Management
- Allocating specific days for learning new concepts vs. implementation
